<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
# About The Project

![Game screenshot with 4 players][product-screenshot]

This is the last project in the JS module of kood/JÃµhvi, where we got to choose a game to make!  
The aim of the exercise was to create a multiplayer game, where the gameplay had interactivity between the players. I will admit that we were a bit strapped for time, so we decided to choose a tighter scope for the project. So, drawing inspiration from games like Tetris 99 and the website tetr.io, we created Battle Tetris. The entire project took about 2 weeks.

### The game

The game is similar to Tetris, in that you have a board with a grid, where you drop pieces and if a line is filled, it disappears and you get points. However, upon clearing 2 or more lines, you send garbage lines to a random opponent, which are filled lines with a single block missing. So, whoever can clear the most lines, with emphasis on clearing multiple lines at once, wins!  
The controls are similar to most other Tetris games, except there is no hold, where you store a block for later use.  
The game features 2 game modes:  
* Multiplayer, where you face off against other human players
* Singleplayer, where you battle it out with bots of varying difficulty

### Built With
